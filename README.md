## Directions

In this project I will be leveraging a variety of skills. The first will be to use the web-scraping and/or API techniques you've learned to collect data on data jobs from http://www.imdb.com and/or http://api.tvmaze.com (or any data source you want to use!). Once I have collected and cleaned the data, I will use it to answer the questions.

### QUESTION 1: Predictive model

To predict rating, I will be building either a classification model, using features like the genre, network, summary etc.


Skills and models that may be useful for this problem:
- NLP
- Unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, clustering)
- Ensemble methods and decision tree models
- SVM models

I also must use at least two models to try to hone in on a well-performing model.

### QUESTION 2: Factors that predict success of show

Using your models, and other techniques (EDA etc.), explain which features best predict performance of a show.
